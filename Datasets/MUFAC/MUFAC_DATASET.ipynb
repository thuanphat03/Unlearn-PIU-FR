    "#### <b>Family Relationship Dataset</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It consists of a total of 900 households and approximately exact 13,068 individuals.\n",
    "2. The last part of the filename, such as \"a1\", indicates the \"age group\".\n",
    "  * This dataset consists of 8 age group classes.\n",
    "  * The task is one of the 8-classes classification problem.\n",
    "  * If we perform random guessing, the accuracy is approximately 12.5%.\n",
    "3. The age classification problem is somewhat challenging, thus, we expect that our dataset will be helpful for evaluating the forgetting performance of a machine unlearning algorithm.\n",
    "  * Our proposed setting has been configured in a way that is almost similar to the NeurIPS Kaggle Competition 2023 held on Kaggle.\n",
    "4. We have utilized \"Family Relationship Dataset\" from AI Hub for constructing this dataset.\n",
